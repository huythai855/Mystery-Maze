# Mystery Maze Log:

## March 27th:
### Description
- First official update, I have just done some examples, but I can imagine how my game will run and what I have to do in the next time.
- Split headers, instead of keeping in only 1 .cpp file like before.
- Thank to my tutor @linhlpv's help, I now can use VSCode and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to write code comfortably, instead of using Codeblocks, which has many disadvantages.
### Issue
- Issue 1: Can't use #ifndef _Win32 to automatically switch the library declaration between Windows and Linux (WSL).
- Issue 2: When I set the **Velocity** of the character (in the game) to 10, it ran properly when running in Windows by Codeblocks. But when I moved to WSL and run by VSCode, the character ran so fast, and I have to change the value of the **Velocity** to 2, as I can see it by my eyes and I haven't known why yet.

## April 22nd, 3:49AM:
### Description
- It's a long time since I last done something with this project because I was up to my ears with other subjects at the university. They were mid-term exams, essays and, of course, lots of homework. One another reason why I have paused this project for such a long time was because I think I have to do more research and learn a lot of unknown things from Lazyfoo and some other sources (such as phattrienphanmem123az).
- But, according to the newest annoucement from my teacher on Piazza, our games will be judged after the April 30th Holiday, so I have to continues and finish this project. This games will be daily updated in the next period of time.
### What's new? [3:49]
- Changed the character from random image (in the last update) to Harry Potter. I will update Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley in next serveral updates. Player can choose the character as they want to play.
- The character can move with walking animation with 4 separate directions smoothly. Sincerely thank **AetherWings** from deviantart.com for sharing RPG sprites of the characters of my game.
### [5:53]
- Added Hermione and Ron.
- Fixed some bugs and clean code.
