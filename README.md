# Mystery Maze Log:

## March 27th, 2022:
### Description
- First official update, I have just done some examples, but I can imagine how my game will run and what I have to do in the next time.
- Split headers, instead of keeping in only 1 .cpp file like before.
- Thank to my tutor @linhlpv's help, I now can use VSCode and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to write code comfortably, instead of using Codeblocks, which has many disadvantages.
### Issue
- Issue 1: Can't use #ifndef _Win32 to automatically switch the library declaration between Windows and Linux (WSL).
- Issue 2: When I set the **Velocity** of the character (in the game) to 10, it ran properly when running in Windows by Codeblocks. But when I moved to WSL and run by VSCode, the character ran so fast, and I have to change the value of the **Velocity** to 2, as I can see it by my eyes and I haven't known why yet.
